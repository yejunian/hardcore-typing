## Build

After cloning this repository and installing dependencies, and after changing `src/data/sentences/**/*`, you should build sentences data. It makes `src/data/sentences.json`, which bundles sentences data:

```plaintext
yarn build-sentences
```

Now, it builds the app for production to the `build` directory:

```plaintext
yarn build
```
